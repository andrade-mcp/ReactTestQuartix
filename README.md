# Quartix - React Test App

The App performs actions below:

A Running Total. When the app starts, the Running Total value should be 0. It should always display a finite number. If the value is 0 or greater, it should be black. If the value is less than 0, it should be red.
An Input where the user can enter a number. The starting value should be blank.
A Plus button. When the user clicks on it, the Running Total should be the old Running Total + the Input value. The Input value should be reset to blank.
A Subtract button. When the user clicks on it, the Running Total should be the old Running Total - the Input value. The Input value should be reset to blank.
A Multiply button. When the user clicks on it, the Running Total should be the old Running Total * the Input value. The Input value should be reset to blank.
A Divide button. When the user clicks on it, the Running Total should be the old Running Total / the Input value. The Input value should be reset to blank.
The user can carry out as many calculations as they like and the Running Total should always be updated to the result of the last calculation.
